# Online Judge - RCE Engine 

Online Judge is an RCE Engine for coding platform like LeetCode, Hackerrank. 

Online Judge can execute C++, Python and Java code in secure container, compare code output with testcases and return appropriate response to the client. 







## General Information

Online Judge is an extention PoC of another project AlgoCode - a DSA platfrom just like Leetcode. 

AlgoCode is a coding platfrom built in microservices architechture. To learn more about AlgoCode, please explore this repository: 
[AlgoCode Backend](https://github.com/Mahboob-A/algocode-backend)

This PoC of Online Judge can execute user codes and run test cases against the code output. 

The Judge can handle the below events: 

    a. AC (Accepted) 
    b. WA (Wrong Answer)
    c. Compilation Error 
    d. Time Limit Exceed 
    e. Memory Limit Exceed 
    f. Segmentation Fault

The Online Judge is a pure docker implementation and no other 3rd party API or service has been used. 





## Run Locally

#### Clone the project

```bash
  https://github.com/Mahboob-A/online-judge.git
```

#### Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd src 
```

#### Create a virtual environment 
For Linux/MacOS
```bash 
  python3 -m venv venv
```

For Windows 
```bash 
  python -m venv venv
```

#### Activate the virtual environment 
For Linux/MacOS
```bash 
  . venv/bin/activate
```

For Windows 
```bash 
  .\env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

#### Install the dependencies 
```bash 
  python -r requirements/dev.txt 
``` 

#### Create the docker image 

**You must creat the below image in order to run the Judge successfully.**

Go the the path to Dockerfile 

```bash
  cd docker/lang/cpp
```
Run the command to create the required images 
```baah
  docker build -t algocode/cpp-image . 
```


#### Start the server
```bash 
  python manage.py runserver 
```

Now you are ready to send request to the API asper API reference below. 
## API Reference

#### Submit Code for Execution 

```http
  POST /submit/execute-robust/
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `lang`    | `string` | **Required**. The language of the Code. Currently only `cpp` is available.  |
| `code`    | `string` | **Required**. The C++ code you want to execute.|
| `input`   | `list[string]` | Input for the program. Empty if no input is neeed. | 
| `testcase` | `list[string]` | Testcase that should be compared to check th e answer of the code execution. |   



## FAQ

#### What is the backend for this project 

The backend of this project is implemented with Django. 

#### Language

Python 

#### Why testcases and input are being passed from client 
This is a PoC for AlgoCode - A DSA problem solving platform implemented in microservices architecture just like Leetcode.  

This PoC simplifies to the code execution. If you just want a monolithic application to test how an secure code execution should happend with test cases comparison to generate a DSA platform like answer this is a handy tool. 

You can extend it to save the testcases and inputs in database. 

All these are implemented in AlgoCode, please refer to here. [AlgoCode](https://github.com/Mahboob-A/algocode-backend)

#### How secure is the execution 
The C++ code will be executed in a secure docker container. The container has no privileges and all other possible privileges has been dropped. 

The container can handle any kind of `DoS Attack` like `fork bomb` and any other form of resource starvation attack. 

A new sibling container is spawn to execute the code.

As the container is auto terminated within `5 seconds`, and only allocated `.5 cpu`, `300mb` of RAM with no `swap` available, hard limit of `nproc` is set to `50` and hard limit of `nofile` set to `50`, 
it can not run any heavily `process` or `descriptor` oriented tasks. 

However, you can tweak the settings as per you need as well. 

#### Why only C++ can be executed 
The main AlgoCode platform is able to rub Python, C++ and Java code. However, This RCE engine will also be updated as I continiously develope the AlgoCode. 

In future updtes, Python and Java execution will be added.

## Future Improvements 
Spawning new container and stop it and cleaning it is expensive process. Hence I am planning to optimize this use case and if the below are achieable, I will bring them in my future rolling of the Juddging engine. 

##### Explore the BOTEK Estimation 
As creating new contianers and deleting them are expensive process, maintain the container's state and execute the code in the contianer without stopping or closing them. 

As the image of the container is very lightweight, we might be able to run concurrent `100+ containers` with `64 GB of RAM`, and `2 Core CPU`.   

But the overhead here is not the number of containers, the overhead is networking and the bigger overhead is disk seek, as the judge needs to write the necessary files to the disk in order to mount it with the container, and again, delete them after the execution is successful. 

##### The Optimation 
If we constantly run 100+ contianers as per our above estimation, and we mount the user files directory dynamically before the code is executed, we can really mitigate almost `1.5/1.0 seconds of cold start` of the docker container. 

In this design, we can dramatically increase the speed and efficiency of a `Synchronous` backend like Django and it would able to handle more concurrent requests with less time. 


##### My Plan 
Yes, I will implement this in my next release. In the future release, the Online Judge RCE Engine will be faster and mitigate the cold start of the docker container.
